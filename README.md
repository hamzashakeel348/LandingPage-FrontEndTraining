Here's the brief overview of the site.

- I used HTML, SCSS for the development of site.
- To deal the responsiveness, I used media queries and adjust the styling according to the screen sizes.
- Separate Folders are maintained for the Images, Styles and the Index.html file
- I used Live Sass compiler to compile SCSS for the CSS and to use the stylings in the html site.
